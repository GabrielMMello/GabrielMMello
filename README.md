### Hello World 👋

  🤖 I'm Gabriel Mello. I'm a self-taught fronted developer that loves to solve puzzels.
My love for logic started when I was a child, playing videogames 👾, trying to solve riddles and playing with toys like Rubik's Cube, what led me to choose an Engineering university 🔧.

  🎓 I passed the entrance exam of four universities: UFRJ, UERJ, PUC and UFF, and choose the UFRJ Mechanical Engineering course, in with I passed in fifth place. 👨‍💻During university I've learned the basics of programming logic in Pascal, and had fun with it.

  Some time after graduation I've started dating a beautiful woman - who is now my wife 😍. She's a Developer. Her father is a Developer. Her older brother is also... a Developer.
Soo... I'v got naturally involved and started learning HTML, Javascript, CSS and React.

  🚀 Starting with small videos on YouTube, some apps like SoloLearn and then going deeper and deeper, I can now learn straight from the language documentation. 🌱 I'm currently learning backend with Typescript and NodeJS.
  

⚡ Fun fact: Despite looking like 100% nerd 🤓, I've been called Social Nerd by some friends. That's because I love other things, like dancing 😋.


I'm looking for my first experience in jobs involvinng Web Development 💼
